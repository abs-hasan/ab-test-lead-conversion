# ðŸ“Š ABXplore: A/B Testing Analytics Platform

## ðŸ§  Project Summary
This project simulates a **real-world A/B testing environment** to evaluate the impact of a new lead onboarding process launched in June 2024. The goal is to demonstrate the complete **analytical journey** â€” from identifying the business problem, through exploratory analysis, hypothesis formation, and statistical testing â€” all the way to actionable recommendations.

The platform uses **Python, dbt, SQL, and Streamlit** to simulate CRM workflows and transform raw data into actionable insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Business Problem
> "Our lead conversion rates have declined in early 2024. Can a new onboarding process fix this? If yes, how much improvement does it bring, and for which segments?"

- âœ… Conversion rates (Closed Won)
- âœ… Time to close
- âœ… Lead responsiveness
- âœ… Revenue per lead

This analysis helps decide whether to roll out the new onboarding strategy across all users.
